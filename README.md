## Project Approach and Description

🚀 Optimizing Small-Scale Storage and Plug-In Solar for Grid Stability and Cost Savings
🔍 Problem Statement

Small-scale plug-in solar systems with battery storage are often not optimized to support grid stability. Prosumers typically charge batteries based on electricity prices rather than real-time grid conditions, potentially contributing to grid stress during peak solar production. Currently, there are no simple dynamic incentives or guidance for prosumers to adjust behavior to align with grid needs, resulting in inefficiencies and missed opportunities to use excess renewable energy.
🎯 Hackathon Challenge

How might we enable prosumers to optimize their energy use and feed-in behavior to support grid stability, lower CO₂ emissions, and increase financial benefits—while ensuring the solution is simple, affordable, and scalable?
📊 Data & Tools Used

    Real-time electricity price and grid demand APIs

    Weather forecast data for solar generation prediction

    Battery & inverter data (where accessible)

    Smart home hardware (e.g. Shelly bulbs, ESP32, sensors)

    Home Assistant + AppDaemon (early prototype phase)

💡 Our Journey & Learnings

We initially focused on developing an automated solution using Home Assistant with AppDaemon, integrating smart home sensors, grid data, and solar predictions to control battery feed-in behavior. However, we encountered several technical and practical limitations:

    Hardware issues: The WISPR smart meter failed to provide usable data despite extensive setup.

    Closed ecosystems: Our battery (Marstek Jupiter C) did not expose data beyond its proprietary app.

    Scalability challenges: Requiring Home Assistant and custom scripting made the solution too complex and niche for the average user.

    Risk of over-automation: Fully automatic control removes user agency and may behave poorly in unpredictable situations.

Following feedback and brainstorming sessions—including an insightful discussion with Sebastian—we pivoted toward a more accessible, low-tech, and user-centric approach.
✅ Final Solution: Visual Feed-In Recommendations via ESP32 & Smart Bulbs

We developed a lightweight, accessible system using a low-cost ESP32 microcontroller and two Shelly smart bulbs. Here’s how it works:

    ESP32 Access Point: On first use, it creates a Wi-Fi access point for users to enter home network credentials.

    Bulb Indicators:

        Green: Feed into the grid now – high demand, good prices.

        Red: Do not feed – excess supply or low demand.

        Yellow: Neutral – consider user preferences or battery status.

    Smart Algorithm on ESP32: It pulls real-time data from grid APIs and weather forecasts to determine optimal feed-in timing based on demand and renewable energy availability, customized for the user's location.

🔧 Why This Works

    Simplicity: No complex home automation system required.

    Affordability: ESP32 and Shelly bulbs are inexpensive and widely available.

    User agency: Clear visual signals guide behavior without removing control.

    Scalability: Easily replicable and adaptable for various home setups.

    Open Source: Fully documented and modifiable for community development.
